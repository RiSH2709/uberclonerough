Uber Ride Clone (Frontend) - Built with Blackbox AI

This project is a rough frontend clone of the Uber ride interface, built using Blackbox AI's image-to-code feature. ðŸŽ¨

âœ¨ Overview
Code Generation: Blackbox AI generated the HTML + CSS code within seconds, giving me a head start on the project.
Customization: I fine-tuned the icons and layout to match the real Uber design.
Efficiency: As a web developer, this workflow saves significant time, allowing me to focus on creative aspects while Blackbox AI handles repetitive coding tasks. âš¡
